Pokemon Database
An SQLite database that stores pokemon game statistics.

The stats table was scraped from Bulbapedia.com using google sheets. 
Then it was scrubbed.
Then separated into lists small enough to be read into the newlymade SQLite database.
A query library was created for users to organize the data by stat.
